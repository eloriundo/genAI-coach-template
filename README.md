# genAI-coach-template
A quick draft in langgraph to build a multi-session "guide", which can be adjusted to performe as a coach, trainer, therapist, teacher, etc.
The main idea is to setup a plan that spans over multiple sessions, and then in each new sessions check history, decide what to focus on for this session, conduct the session, and document it. 
I'm keeping it simple and general, so it can be adjusted to specific use cases and integrations.
